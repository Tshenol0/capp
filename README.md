CAPP(Chat App)

Description :

This is a chat web application. The first page shown is the login screen, which also includes a link to the registration page. Users must either log in with their email and password or register if they have not yet created an account.

During login and registration, multiple validations ensure that all required fields are completed and that the information provided is correct and valid. If any errors occur, an appropriate message is displayed.

After logging in, users can edit their profiles by updating their first name, last name, status, or profile picture. They can also search for other registered users. From the search results, a user can view another userâ€™s profile and choose to follow them.

To start a chat, both users must follow each other. Once they have followed each other, a chat channel is established and real-time messaging becomes available.

Users can log out of the application at any time.
